# OSINT Challenge — "Vipps Backoffice"

## 🧭 Executive Summary
Can you find the backoffice website of Vipps? Send the domain as a flag!

## 🧰 Methodology
For this task we run over to crt.sh where we can find all the SSL or TLS certificates of the particular targeted domain. After inputting “Vipps.no” We can clearly see that one of the domains contains the term “backoffice” in it. The flag is the domain’s name.

## 🧩 Lessons Learned
CRT logs are valuable for discovering subdomains not exposed on public sites.
